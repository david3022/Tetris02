# Tetris02

Hello! Welcome to my Tetris project

##DESCRIPTION
This is a visually simple project that demonstrates matrix handling with JavaScript.

Just like in the original Tetris, the pieces will descend automatically, and you will earn points for completing a line. 

##Game Controls
You can rotate pieces by pressing the up arrow key on your keyboard. 
Use the left or right arrow keys to decide where the piece should be positioned, and press the down arrow if you want it to drop faster.



##REQUIREMENTS
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
